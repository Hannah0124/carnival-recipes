Lauren's Mac-n-Cheese Pizza
--------------------------

Servings: 8

Ingredients:
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups grated sharp Cheddar
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

4. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
9. Whisk in the milk until you have a thick enough sauce that it coats the back of a spoon.
11. Turn the heat to low. Add the pasta to the cheese sauce and stir to coat. Cover and keep warm.
12. In a small bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, chives and olive oil.
13. Take the rest of the crumbled bacon and add it to the bowl, stirring well to combine.
15. Remove from the oven and set down. Spread the macaroni and cheese on the pizza, being careful to leave a 1-inch border.
